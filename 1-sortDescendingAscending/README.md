### Sort Descending:
Your code sorts the array in descending order and then logs the first element, which will be the largest element in the array. Hereâ€™s the complete and corrected code:

```javascript
let aray = [112, 42, 23, 4, 5];

let baa = aray.sort((a, b) => b - a);

console.log(baa[0]); This will log the largest element in the array
```

### Explanation:
1. **Initial Array**: `let aray = [112, 42, 23, 4, 5];` initializes the array.
2. **Sorting**: `let baa = aray.sort((a, b) => b - a);` sorts the array in descending order.
    - The sort function `(a, b) => b - a` compares two elements, `a` and `b`. If `b` is greater than `a`, `b` comes before `a`, resulting in a descending order.
3. **Logging the Largest Element**: `console.log(baa[0]);` logs the first element of the sorted array, which is the largest element.

### Output:
The output will be the largest element in the array:

```
112
```

### Additional Notes:
- **Array Mutation**: The `sort()` method sorts the array in place, meaning it changes the original array (`aray` in this case).
- **Alternative Method**: If you do not want to mutate the original array, you can create a copy of the array before sorting:

```javascript
let aray = [112, 42, 23, 4, 5];
let baa = [...aray].sort((a, b) => b - a);
console.log(baa[0]); Logs the largest element in the array without mutating the original array
```

In this alternative method, the spread operator (`...aray`) is used to create a shallow copy of the original array before sorting it. This way, the original array remains unchanged.
